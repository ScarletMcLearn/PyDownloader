# PyDownloader
Python downloader in PyQt4 (pluralsight course)

Created a python downloader by following pluralsight course(https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=python-desktop-application-development&author=bo-milanovich&name=python-desktop-application-development-m1-intro&clip=0&mode=live)

Some minor changes to make the program work with python version 2.7.9

The program is fully cross-platform and I learned alot about PyQt writing it.
